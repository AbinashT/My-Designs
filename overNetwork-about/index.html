            Our mission is centered around <strong>fostering inclusivity, making a blockchain protocol accessible to
                all.</strong>
            This
            principle is fundamental to our aim of constructing a genuinely decentralized blockchain network. Our vision
            is to <strong>create a global peer-to-peer network</strong> that welcomes <strong>contributions from
                individuals
                worldwide</strong>,
            enhancing
            its security and stability through collective collaboration. Think of OverProtocol as a blockchain protocol
            for <strong>Home Staking</strong>, enabling participation in the blockchain network directly from personal
            computers and
            devices.

        <span class="topic-3">High Resource Requirements</span>

        <div class="content-2">
            OverProtocol takes on the challenge of high resource requirements in the blockchain space with innovative
            solutions. Extensive data accumulation and resource-intensive demands have historically led to issues of
            centralization, excluding everyday users. To counter this, OverProtocol introduces a data hierarchy and
            leverages Ethanos technology for efficient data partitioning between layers. This approach dramatically
            reduces the network's resource demands, resulting in a blockchain system with a limited state size—up to 20
            times lighter than conventional methods. As a result, OverProtocol becomes far more accessible to users with
            varying hardware capabilities.

        <span class="topic-3">Restricted Participation</span>
        <div class="content-2">
            In the traditional landscape, numerous blockchain networks face participation limitations, often favoring a
            privileged few entities with substantial capital, notably in systems like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).
            This setup can lead to an undesirable concentration of power and control, posing risks for individuals who
            delegate their assets to these centralized entities. In contrast, OverProtocol champions a more inclusive
            consensus mechanism. This means that a larger number of participants can take part in block validation,
            reducing the concentration of power. By broadening the pool of participants and implementing mechanisms for
            accountability, OverProtocol promotes a more decentralized and inclusive consensus protocol, mitigating the
            issues associated with restricted participation.

        <span class="topic-3">Technical Complexity </span>

        <div class="content-2">
            In many existing systems, the complexity of cryptographic keys, wallet management, and transaction processes
            can be overwhelming for users. Additionally, unfriendly user interfaces and convoluted procedures discourage
            mainstream adoption. OverProtocol addresses these issues by prioritizing user-friendliness and
            accessibility. It simplifies node setup and network interactions, making them more intuitive and less
            daunting for users of varying expertise levels. By improving user interfaces and streamlining procedures,
            OverProtocol ensures that blockchain technology is not only technically advanced but also welcoming and
            inclusive, ultimately fostering wider adoption and making blockchain more accessible to all.
